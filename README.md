# Water Monitor ðŸŒŠ

## About The Project

Water Monitor is a cutting-edge platform designed to monitor water levels in various locations in real-time. By integrating data from external sensors and allowing for the addition of proprietary sensors, the project aims to offer comprehensive insights into water conditions to support sustainable water management practices.

## Technologies

- **NextJS**: Utilized for its server-side rendering capabilities, enhancing SEO and performance.
- **Tailwind**: Employs a utility-first approach to CSS, facilitating efficient styling.
- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and enhances the development experience by adding static typing to JavaScript.

## Environment Variables

To configure the project correctly, copy the `.env.example` file to `.env.local` and update it with the appropriate values:

- `NODE_RED_API`: For internal API calls (server-side).
- `API_USERNAME` & `API_PASSWORD`: Credentials for authenticating with the Node Red API using basic auth.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_GRAFANA_URL`: The public URL for Grafana dashboards, integrated directly into the dashboard.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`: The API key used to show the Google Maps embeds; At least the following APIs need to be enabled: `Javascript API`, `Places`, `Geocoded`, `Maps`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` & `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY`: The API keys necessary to send and receive push notifications, execute `web-push generate-vapid-keys` to get valid keys. You will need to have `web-push` installed.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APPLICATION_URL`: This is the public application URL, necessary for non relative fetches
